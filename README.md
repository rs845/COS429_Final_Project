# DeepFake Detection with Compressed Media

This project is a final project for Princeton's COS429: Computer Vision course. It looks specifically at the task of detecting fake people in compressed images (as is the case for images on social media platforms). This project investigates different common model's performance on compressed images and detectability across different compression algorithms.
